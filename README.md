### Description

The main goal of this subject was to develop 3D environments focused in [Computer Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics).
We developed projects written in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) with the appropriated technology of image synthesys. This whole subject was based on [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL).

### Project 1 and 2

The aim of this projects was to introduce new graphic techniques like 2D/3D surfaces, animations, and shaders based in GLSL ES 1.0. We created a parser to read data from a .lsx file, converting it to a WebGL scene.

### Project 3

It was intended to create a 3D environment developed in WebGL to represent the game states of a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) board game and make use of a game interface [dat.gui](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/). We also developed a [parser](./project 3/graphics/Objs) to import .obj files into the scene. A project with the following requirements:

- [x] Create a game scene
- [x] Modeling and movement of game pieces
- [x] Game environments
- [X] Illumination
- [x] Game type (Bot vs Bot / Human vs Bot / Human vs Human) 
- [x] Undo functionality
- [x] Point of View animated translation
- [X] Counter (Including a marker and a timer)
- [X] Replay functionality
